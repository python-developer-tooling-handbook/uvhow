## Development

### Setup

Install pre-commit hooks for code quality:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This will automatically:
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Fix end-of-file issues
- Format Python code with Black
- Sort imports with isort
- Validate YAML/TOML syntax
- Check for merge conflicts

### Releasing New Versions

Use the included version bump script to release new versions:

```bash
# Preview what will happen
python bump_version.py patch --dry-run

# Bump patch version (0.1.2 -> 0.1.3) and deploy
python bump_version.py patch

# Bump minor version (0.1.2 -> 0.2.0) and deploy
python bump_version.py minor

# Bump major version (0.1.2 -> 1.0.0) and deploy
python bump_version.py major
```

The script will:
1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Commit the version change
3. Create a git tag (e.g., `v0.1.3`)
4. Push the tag to trigger GitHub Actions deployment to PyPI

**Requirements:**
- Clean git working directory (no uncommitted changes)
- Push access to the repository
